Subject: [PATCH 27/32] ASoC: TI AESS: add autogating-enable function,
 callable from architecture code
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add a basic header file for the TI AESS IP block, located in the OMAP4
Audio Back-End subsystem.

Currently, this header file only contains a function to enable the
AESS internal clock auto-gating.  This will be used by a subsequent
patch to ensure that the AESS won't block the entire chip
low-power-idle mode.  We wish to be able to place the AESS into idle
even when no AESS driver has been compiled in.
