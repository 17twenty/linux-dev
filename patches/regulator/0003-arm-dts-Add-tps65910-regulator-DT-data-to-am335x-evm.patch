Subject: [PATCH 3/4] arm/dts: Add tps65910 regulator DT data to
 am335x-evm.dts

Add tps65910 regulator device tree data to AM335x-EVM by adding
regulator consumers with tightened constraints and regulator-name.
TPS65910 regulator handle can be obtained by using this regulator
name.

This patch also add I2C node with I2C frequency and tps65910 PMIC
I2C slave address.
